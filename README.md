# PC-Cleanup_Tool
This is an basic batch program that deletes internet cookies, deletes temporary files, defrag and clean up disk. Warning this has not been tested on > Windows 7. 
<br>
I did not write this script I found it at => "http://www.instructables.com/id/5-Cool-Batch-Files/"
<br>
This is for a quicker way to access this. 
<br>
To run the program just name the extension ".bat" and then click to run. It should pop up as gui.
